## C++ History and Setup 
C++ is a general purpose, object oriented language. 
### History 
C++ was developed in 1979 by Danish Computer Scientist, Bjarne Stroustrup. In the process of completing his PHD at Bell Telephone Laboratories, now known as Nokia Bell  Labs, he wanted a language similar to C but with an additional implementation of classes, inlining, basic inheritance, default functioning argument etc. The language was initially known as â€˜C with Classes' but was modified in 1983 to C++.
